# Visual Novel Manager

This Visual Novel Manager is used to store and manage visual novels. You can add visual novels to the program, and it will download metadata about the selected title. You can also change your votes and comments on novels if you have an account on VNDB.org

### Version

### Tech
Here are a few github projects that I ussed to create this program:
* [VndbClient] - Used for connecting to the API

Feel free to suggest bug fixes, UI/UX changes, or anything that you think needs changing. 
I am open to ideas to make this better.
