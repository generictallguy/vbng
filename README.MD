# [Obselete] Visual Novel Manager

This Visual Novel Manager is used to store and manage visual novels. You can add visual novels to the program, and it will download metadata about the selected title. You can also change your votes and comments on novels if you have an account on VNDB.org

### Notice

All issues are being closed, and creating new issues are disabled, for I will only be working on my new version, and not this one.
