# [Obselete] Visual Novel Manager

This Visual Novel Manager is used to store and manage visual novels. You can add visual novels to the program, and it will download metadata about the selected title. You can also change your votes and comments on novels if you have an account on VNDB.org

### Notice
This project is no longer being worked on, as I am doing a complete rewrite of the program. The new program should have significantly less bugs when finished, but it is still under heavy development.

All issues are being closed, and creating new issues are disabled, for I will only be working on my new version, and not this one.

### Version
1.1.0

### Tech
Here are a few github projects that I ussed to create this program:
* [VndbClient] - Used for connecting to the API
* [VN-Database-Program] - used as a base for my program


### Building
You will need the Json.Newtonsoft library, as well as the libraries from SqlCeToolbox <https://github.com/ErikEJ/SqlCeToolbox> to build this

### Development

Feel free to suggest bug fixes, UI/UX changes, or anything that you think needs changing. 
I am open to ideas to make this better.
